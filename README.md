This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What is it?

Todo list with the functionality to add an item, edit and delete.
This is also set for Local storage.

## information to remember.

Using the map syntax caused me a lot of issues.

Remember: map will always return the same number of elements as the original array. For example, if there are 5 objects in an array, the result will also contain 5 objects. Those objects can be transformed or changed, but you cannot add or remove elements with map.

Index - can be an issue especially with local storange and index of the map item.
